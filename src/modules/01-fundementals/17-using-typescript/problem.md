## Mission
Create a **Hello** component. Component should render "Hello, {prop.name}".
This time, we're going to use typescript. Remember to use `.tsx` extension for in the component file name, and define a props type for your component.


## Steps
1. Create a file for the `Hello` component: `exercise/Hello.tsx`
2. In `exercise/Hello.tsx`, define the `Hello` component. Make sure it accepts the prop `name` and renders `Hello, {name}`.
3. Export the component by adding `export default Hello;` at the end of the file
4. Import and render the `Hello` component in `exercise/App.tsx`.
5. Run all tests from `App.test.jsx`.
