## Mission
Create a **ClickCounter** component. Component should render counter, `Add` and `Subtract` buttons. <br>
After clicking on `Add` button counter should be increased by 1, and on `Subtract` button click should be decreased by 1. <br>
Counter is starting from **0**. (Use local state!)

**Use hooks instead of class components!**

## Steps 
1. Create file `exercise/ClickCounter.tsx` and export class component `ClickCounter` as default.
2. Import component in `exercise/App.tsx` and render it.
3. Add button to component with text `Add`.
4. Add button to component with text `Subtract`.
5. Handle button click event -> increase/decrease counter by 1 each time one of buttons has been clicked.
6. Add paragraph (`<p/>`)  with number of times button has been clicked.
7. Run all tests from `App.test.tsx`.
